# Rust Currency Library

A very small library, providing a way to represent currencies in Rust.

[Documentation](http://tahler.github.io/currency-rs/currency/index.html).

[Crate](https://crates.io/crates/currency).

## Progress

I am slowly but surely working on an implementation of an IEEE standard decimal encoding in another [repo](https://github.com/Tahler/decimal-rs). 

Once that is finished, this currency library will be refactored to use the MUCH smaller encoding, allowing the type to be cloned and copied freely.
