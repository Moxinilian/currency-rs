Feel free to contribute to this small library. 

## Contributions

Rust-lang-currency has some limitations with precision. Look at the `Mul` 
implementation for `f32` and `f64`. Precision is currently truncated. I would 
think either rounding the numbers or redesigning it to handle further 
precision than two decimal places would be best. 

I'd be willing to help with this, I'm just busy with classes here. Let me 
know if you start working on it!

Any other contributions, even as simple as refactoring for cleaner Rust code, 
are welcome as well.

## Before the Merge Request
